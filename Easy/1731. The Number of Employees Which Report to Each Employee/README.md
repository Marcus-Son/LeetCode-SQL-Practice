## ðŸ§¾ Problem Description

### Table: `Employees`

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| employee_id  | int     |
| name         | varchar |
| reports_to   | int     |
| age          | int     |

- `employee_id` is the **primary key**.
- `reports_to` refers to the `employee_id` of that employee's direct manager.
- Some employees have `reports_to` set to **null**, meaning they donâ€™t report to anyone.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Find all employees who are **managers**, i.e., at least one employee reports to them.  
Return:
- their `employee_id`
- `name`
- `reports_count`: number of direct reports
- `average_age`: average age of direct reports, **rounded to the nearest integer**

Return results ordered by `employee_id`.
