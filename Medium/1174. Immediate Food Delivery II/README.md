## ðŸ§  Problem Summary

You're given a `Delivery` table that logs food delivery orders. Each row contains a customerâ€™s order date and their preferred delivery date.

- If the `customer_pref_delivery_date` is **the same as** the `order_date`, it's considered an **immediate** delivery.
- Otherwise, it's a **scheduled** delivery.
- Each customer has **exactly one first order**, defined as the order with the **earliest order_date**.
