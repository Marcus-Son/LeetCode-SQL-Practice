## üßæ Problem Description

### Table: `Employee`

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| department  | varchar |
| managerId   | int     |

- `id` is the **primary key** (each employee has a unique ID).
- Each row represents an employee, their department, and their manager.
- If `managerId` is `NULL`, the employee **does not have a manager**.
- No employee is their own manager.

---

## üéØ Objective

Write an SQL query to find all **managers** who have **at least 5 direct reports** (employees who list them as their `managerId`).

- Return the manager's `name` only.
- The result can be in any order.

### Input

**Employee**

| id  | name  | department | managerId |

| 103 | James | A          | 101       |
| 104 | Amy   | A          | 101       |
| 105 | Anne  | A          | 101       |
| 106 | Ron   | B          | 101       |

## üîç Explanation

- Employee `101` (John) is the manager of employees `102`, `103`, `104`, `105`, and `106`.
- John has **5 direct reports**, so he qualifies for the result.
- No other employee has 5 or more direct reports.
