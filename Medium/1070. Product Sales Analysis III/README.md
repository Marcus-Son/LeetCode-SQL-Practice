## ðŸ§  Problem Summary

You are given a `Sales` table that logs product sales over multiple years. Each sale is associated with:
- A product ID
- The year of the sale
- Quantity sold
- Unit price

A product may have multiple sale records across different years, and even within the same year.

The goal is to find **all sale records for each product in the first year** that product was sold.

### `Sales`

| `product_id`| int  | Foreign key referencing the product         |
